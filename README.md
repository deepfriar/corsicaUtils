Utility Functions From Corsica

This is a packaged-up version of the helper functions used across all parts of the former Corsica code universe.

These aren't intended for top-level use, but only for construction of the `dryscrape` scraper and other Corsica software.

Installation instructions in R:

```
if(!require(devtools)) {install.packages("devtools")}
devtools::install_github("deepfriar/corsicaUtils")
```
